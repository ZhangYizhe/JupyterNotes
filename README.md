# JupyterNotes
This project aims to achieve some core machine learning algorithms by hand. I think it is a very important thing to deeply understand these concepts. I just use some fundamental frameworks to assist me, such as `Pandas`, `Numpy`, and `Matplotlib`. If you find some bugs please feel free to put an issue with me. I will carefully browse each one and try to fix it.
